## Project Description

This program is a garage management information system that is intended to serve the needs of system users in a garage looking to reliably store, retrieve, and display information that is relevant to a garage.

This program was developed by students in Queen Mary University of London, during the academic year 2016-2017, for the computer science module ECS506U Software Engineering Project.

Graphics Support

For JavaFX applications to take advantage of the new hardware acceleration pipeline provided by JavaFX, your system must feature one of the graphics cards below. Otherwise JavaFX will default to the Java2D software pipeline.

Graphics card - Supported Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):

NVIDIA	
Mobile GPUs: GeForce 8M and 100M series or higher, NVS 2100M series or higher, and Mobility Quadro FX 300M series or higher
Desktop GPUs: GeForce 8 and 100 series or higher
Workstation GPUs: Quadro FX 300 series or higher
ATI	
Mobile GPUs: Mobility Radeon HD 3000, 4000, and 5000 series
Desktop GPUs: Radeon HD 2400, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 series
Intel	
Mobile GPUs: GMA 4500MHD and GMA HD
Desktop GPUs: GMA 4500 and GMA HD

- To avoid rendering issues on Windows platforms, upgrade the ATI driver to Catalyst 11.09 or later.
- JavaFX supports graphic hardware acceleration on any certified Mac OS X system.
- On Linux platforms, graphic hardware acceleration is only supported for Nvidia cards (proprietary drivers only).
